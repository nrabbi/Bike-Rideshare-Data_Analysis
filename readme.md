## Title: Bike Rideshare Data Analysis
## Author: Nazmul Hasan Rabbi
## Date: March 5 2022

### Background

In 2016, a company launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, the marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are members.

The company's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps attract more customers, they believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

### Task

Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. The team are interested in analyzing the historical bike trip data to identify trends.

The assigned task is to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use bikes differently?

Stakeholders: Data Analytics Team, Director of Marketing and Executive Team.
